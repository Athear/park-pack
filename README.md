First, create a user profile.  Once that is created you can start dishing about your doggo.  Add a picture along with other info about your dog which makes it easier for us to connect you with other dogs and owners for fun adventures!  From the dashboard the user can select other dog profiles to add to your pack.  Once friendships are initiated, you can view your pack from the side scrolling menu.
